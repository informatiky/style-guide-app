# Writing with Style main points## The Rules1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.‚Äù## Chapter 1### Why are old words short and best? A brief history#### Use Anghlo-Saxon words (p11)* Use old and short words. They form the basics of the english language because English is an Anglo-Saxon language.* If you have the choice between an Anglo-Saxon word and its Latin or French equivalent, the former will give you a grounded and genuine feel, the latter an elevated, impersonal one. #### _Prefer_: (p13)buy to purchase or acquire <br>let to permit <br>about to approximately <br>enough to sufficient <br>give to donate <br>help to aid <br>get to obtain <br>make to manufacture <br>set up to establish <br>show to demonstrate <br>spending to expenditure <br>give up to relinquish <br>break to violate <br>hand out to distribute <br>present (noun) to gift <br>people to persons <br>rich to wealthy <br>but to however <br>after to following <br>### Nouns like a rock#### Use concrete nouns (p14-16)* Concrete nouns are "nouns which you can stub your toe on".* The worst Abstract nouns are nominalisations, boring nouns made from verbs or adjectives.* Concrete nouns make life easier for your readers, who can "see" what you are talking about as well as think about it.* Concrete nouns kee you focused on what you are actually writing about.* Sometimes an abstract word is the most strictly accurate one. But vivid writing often relies on a reader's common sense to fill in the picture.#### _Replace_: (p16)workforce with workers <br>compensation with pay <br>revenue with sales <br>high-net-worth individuals with rich people <br>inventory with goods, stocks, products on shelves <br>civil society with ngos (or perhaps community organisations) <br>conflict with fighting or war <br>the intelligence community with spies <br>academic community with scholars <br>the international community with nearly anything more accurate. <br>### Verbs that do something#### Use vivid verbs (p18)* Abstract nouns combine with empty verbs, creating boring sentences.* Vivid verbs are not particularly action-packed verbs, but all call a visual image to mind.* Especially lively verbs have another quality: they save the need for extra words by packing it with meaning.* Tangible subjects are clear in the mind. <br>In short, when a reader's mind begins to engage with a piece of writing, they are more likely to finish it and remember it. Maybe even act on it.#### _Replace_: (p19)demonstrates an unwillingness to with refuses to <br>manifests avoidance behaviour with avoids <br>the proliferation of abstractions exhibits a deadening tendency upon writing with empty words deaden writing <br>### Euphemisms and exaggeration#### Don't weaken a subject (p19)* For example "abuses of power" instead of clearer descriptions like "fraud" or "bribery".#### _Replace_: (p19)homelessness with people sleeping rough <br>human-rights abuses with torture, murder, massacres, etc <br>civilian casualties or collateral damage with dead civilians <br>mortality with death <br>voting irregularities with vote-rigging <br>redundancies with lay-offs <br>the underprivileged with poor people, people struggling to pay the bills, etc <br>sexual assault with rape, groping, etc <br>kinetic action with battle <br>#### Don't exaggerate * Not every problem is a crisis, nor is every allegation of wrongdoing a scandal.### The use and abuse of jargon#### Avoid Pomposity (p20)* None of these improves on the older, more common word; nothing has been  added except novelty.#### _Replace_: (p20)summits with meetings and conferences <br>granular with detailed <br>ideation with brainstorming <br>learnings with lessons <br>optics with appearances <br>#### Avoid Verbing (p20)* There is nothing inherently wrong with verbs formed from nouns. But you are more likely to annoy than to entertain with novel verbings.* Contact and Host are fine.#### _Replace_: (p21)to impact with to have an impact on <br>to access with to gain access to <br>to showcase <br>to source <br>to segue <br>to target <br>#### _Don't Use:_ (p21)to action <br>to gift <br>to interface <br>to whiteboard <br>#### Avoid Misdirection (p21)* Many jargon words seem designed to be obscure. Call these things what they are.#### _Don't Use_: (p21)synergy <br>issue <br>cyclical downturn <br>secular downturn <br>reallocation of resources <br>refocusing <br>downsizing <br>rightsizing <br>#### Teach specialist terms to the reader (p21)* Before using jargon, make sure to identify the terms you will re-use often enough.* Using familiar concept is often most effective.* When you will not be re-using terms frequently, rephrasing is your best strategy.#### Avoid using acronyms and initialisms (p22)* Instead, consider short forms and synonyms### The basket of deplorables#### Avoid words that are vogueish, self-important, vague or misleading (p22)#### _Don't use_: (p22)address (as a transitive verb; try deal with, attend to) <br>aspirational <br>facilitate <br>famously (if it's famous, do you need to say so?) <br>high-profile <br>iconic <br>individual (as a synonym for person, unless there is no alternative) <br>inform (as a pretentious verb meaning to influence) <br>implode (since nature abhors a vacuum, few things actually implode) <br>key (as an adjective; especially key players, and do not say this decision is key) <br>major (try cutting it and seeing if context does the job instead) <br>move (as a synonym for decision, policy or change: The move served to highlight...) <br>narrative <br>paradigm <br>participate in (try take part in) <br>passionate <br>proactive <br>players (unless in sports and games) <br>prestigious (this means the author likes it) <br>reputational <br>savvy <br>segue <br>showcase (verb) <br>source (verb) <br>spikes (many rises so described turn out to have no descents) <br>stakeholders <br>supportive (try helpful) <br>surreal <br>trajectory (long word for course or path) <br>transformative <br>trigger (as a verb. Try cause, lead to, result in, etc.) <br>vision <br>wannabes <br>_A rule of thumb: was this word used two decades ago, and will it still be used that way two decades from now? If not, consider an alternative._## Chapter 2## Chapter 3## Chapter 4## Chapter 5## Chapter 6## Chapter 7## Chapter 8## Chapter 9## Chapter 10
