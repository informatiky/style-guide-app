# Writing with Style main points## The Rules1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.”## Chapter 1### Why are old words short and best? A brief history#### Use Anghlo-Saxon words (p11)* Use old and short words. They form the basics of the english language because English is an Anglo-Saxon language.* If you have the choice between an Anglo-Saxon word and its Latin or French equivalent, the former will give you a grounded and genuine feel, the latter an elevated, impersonal one. #### _Prefer_: (p13)buy to purchase or acquire <br>let to permit <br>about to approximately <br>enough to sufficient <br>give to donate <br>help to aid <br>get to obtain <br>make to manufacture <br>set up to establish <br>show to demonstrate <br>spending to expenditure <br>give up to relinquish <br>break to violate <br>hand out to distribute <br>present (noun) to gift <br>people to persons <br>rich to wealthy <br>but to however <br>after to following <br>### Nouns like a rock#### Use concrete nouns (p14-16)* Concrete nouns are "nouns which you can stub your toe on".* The worst Abstract nouns are nominalisations, boring nouns made from verbs or adjectives.* Concrete nouns make life easier for your readers, who can "see" what you are talking about as well as think about it.* Concrete nouns kee you focused on what you are actually writing about.* Sometimes an abstract word is the most strictly accurate one. But vivid writing often relies on a reader's common sense to fill in the picture.#### _Replace_: (p16)workforce with workers <br>compensation with pay <br>revenue with sales <br>high-net-worth individuals with rich people <br>inventory with goods, stocks, products on shelves <br>civil society with ngos (or perhaps community organisations) <br>conflict with fighting or war <br>the intelligence community with spies <br>academic community with scholars <br>the international community with nearly anything more accurate. <br>### Verbs that do something#### Use vivid verbs (p18)* Abstract nouns combine with empty verbs, creating boring sentences.* Vivid verbs are not particularly action-packed verbs, but all call a visual image to mind.* Especially lively verbs have another quality: they save the need for extra words by packing it with meaning.* Tangible subjects are clear in the mind. <br>In short, when a reader's mind begins to engage with a piece of writing, they are more likely to finish it and remember it. Maybe even act on it.#### _Replace_: (p19)demonstrates an unwillingness to with refuses to <br>manifests avoidance behaviour with avoids <br>the proliferation of abstractions exhibits a deadening tendency upon writing with empty words deaden writing <br>### Euphemisms and exaggeration#### Don't weaken a subject (p19)* For example "abuses of power" instead of clearer descriptions like "fraud" or "bribery".#### _Replace_: (p19)homelessness with people sleeping rough <br>human-rights abuses with torture, murder, massacres, etc <br>civilian casualties or collateral damage with dead civilians <br>mortality with death <br>voting irregularities with vote-rigging <br>redundancies with lay-offs <br>the underprivileged with poor people, people struggling to pay the bills, etc <br>sexual assault with rape, groping, etc <br>kinetic action with battle <br>#### Don't exaggerate * Not every problem is a crisis, nor is every allegation of wrongdoing a scandal.### The use and abuse of jargon#### Avoid Pomposity (p20)* None of these improves on the older, more common word; nothing has been  added except novelty.#### _Replace_: (p20)summits with meetings and conferences <br>granular with detailed <br>ideation with brainstorming <br>learnings with lessons <br>optics with appearances <br>#### Avoid Verbing (p20)* There is nothing inherently wrong with verbs formed from nouns. But you are more likely to annoy than to entertain with novel verbings.* Contact and Host are fine.#### _Replace_: (p21)to impact with to have an impact on <br>to access with to gain access to <br>to showcase <br>to source <br>to segue <br>to target <br>#### _Replace:_ (p21)to action <br>to gift <br>to interface <br>to whiteboard <br>#### Avoid Misdirection (p21)* Many jargon words seem designed to be obscure. Call these things what they are.#### _Replace_: (p21)synergy <br>issue <br>cyclical downturn <br>secular downturn <br>reallocation of resources <br>refocusing <br>downsizing <br>rightsizing <br>#### Teach specialist terms to the reader (p21)* Before using jargon, make sure to identify the terms you will re-use often enough.* Using familiar concept is often most effective.* When you will not be re-using terms frequently, rephrasing is your best strategy.#### Avoid using acronyms and initialisms (p22)* Instead, consider short forms and synonyms### The basket of deplorables#### Avoid words that are vogueish, self-important, vague or misleading (p22)#### _Replace_: (p22)address (as a transitive verb; try deal with, attend to) <br>aspirational <br>facilitate <br>famously (if it's famous, do you need to say so?) <br>high-profile <br>iconic <br>individual (as a synonym for person, unless there is no alternative) <br>inform (as a pretentious verb meaning to influence) <br>implode (since nature abhors a vacuum, few things actually implode) <br>key (as an adjective; especially key players, and do not say this decision is key) <br>major (try cutting it and seeing if context does the job instead) <br>move (as a synonym for decision, policy or change: The move served to highlight...) <br>narrative <br>paradigm <br>participate in (try take part in) <br>passionate <br>proactive <br>players (unless in sports and games) <br>prestigious (this means the author likes it) <br>reputational <br>savvy <br>segue <br>showcase (verb) <br>source (verb) <br>spikes (many rises so described turn out to have no descents) <br>stakeholders <br>supportive (try helpful) <br>surreal <br>trajectory (long word for course or path) <br>transformative <br>trigger (as a verb. Try cause, lead to, result in, etc.) <br>vision <br>wannabes <br>_A rule of thumb: was this word used two decades ago, and will it still be used that way two decades from now? If not, consider an alternative._## Chapter 2#### Use fresh, vivid metaphors (p26)* Fresh imagery is effective because it gives the reader two ways to process what you are saying: one logical and linguistic, and another visual.#### _Replace_: (p26)accident waiting to happen <br> chattering classes <br>deer in the headlights <br>eye-watering sums <br>fit for purpose <br>game-changer <br>going forward (in the sense of in future) <br>the green light <br>grinding to a halt <br>heavy lifting <br>honeymoon period <br>level playing-field <br>paradigm shift <br>perfect storm <br>poster child <br>pulling teeth <br>rack up (profits, etc) <br>ramping up <br>tipping point <br>too close to call <br>wake-up call <br>whopping bills <br> ### Metaphor magic #### Metaphors require care (p29)* Think thoroughly about the metaphor you are using, explain differences between the metaphor and the reality, and use metaphors only where necessary. * You could, for example, build up a metaphor through a whole piece of writing or refer to it regularly but don't over do it.### Borrowing specialist terms#### Crescendo (p30)A crescendo in music is a passage of increasing volume (it means "growing" in Italian), not the point of peak volume.#### Epicentre (p31)An epicentre is not the heart of an earthquake, but the spot on the Earth's surface above it (from epi-, Greek for "upon").#### Eye of the storm (p31)A hurricane is calm, not most intense, at the eye of the storm.#### Calculus (p31)Calculus deals with limits, and differentiation and integration of functions; for example, how position, velocity and acceleration are related. For those who know it, it is not just a fancy synonym for calculation, political or otherwise.#### Quantum Leap (p31)Quantum leap: not a big one. The idiom arises from physics, where the quanta involved are fixed multiples of a minuscule amount of energy. Use to describe a sudden change without intermediate stages, not a vast leap.#### Begging the question (p31)Begging the question: this phrase originated in classical philosophy, meaning to try to smuggle the conclusion you are trying to argue into an assumption. If someone says Illegal immigrants must be deported because they have broken the law, they are presupposing (or avoiding arguing) that the law is just or wise, and so begging the question. But if you merely mean that something raises or prompts the question, say that.#### Parsing (p31)In grammar, this means noting the details of function and form of the words in a sentence. Avoid using it as a fancy synonym for examining.#### Exponential growth (p31)Not just any rapid growth, but the kind implied by 2¹, 2², 2³, 2⁴, 2⁵, 2⁶, or 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.#### Inflection point (p31) Borrowed from calculus to describe a point where a curve's concavity changes. This should not be used to indicate a mere change in direction.#### Marginal (p32)Poor-quality land at the edge of a field brought into cultivation is marginal. The cost of producing just one more widget in your factory is the marginal cost of production. The decreasing level of happiness you gain from making progressively more money is diminishing marginal utility. These are interesting and precise uses of marginal. As a synonym for slight or small, it is of marginal usefulness.### Variation, elegant and inelegant#### Use synonyms where they enhance your writing, not where they distract (p32)#### Use initialism occasionally (p32)* Especially if the initialism is not well known use more transparent phrasings.### Redundancy#### Space is at a premium (p33)* Where you can, remove words that do not add to the meaning of a sentence. For example when implied by context.#### _Replace_: (p33)now <br>currently <br>at present <br>ongoing <br>today <br> -> and similar are suggested by present tense, use them when contrasting with another time. <br> <br>real <br> -> unless you mean inflation <br> <br>there is/are <br> <br>has the ability to, the skills to <br> -> can <br> <br>absolute certainty (certainty) <br>pilotless drone (drone) <br>razed to the ground (razed) <br>track record (record) <br>wilderness area (wilderness) <br>policymaking process (policymaking) <br>large-scale (large or just big) <br>weather conditions (weather) <br>bought up (bought) <br>sold off (sold) <br>headed up by (headed by) <br>cut back, v (cut) <br>cutbacks, n (cuts) <br>end result (result) <br>for free (free) <br>from whence (whence) <br>final outcome (outcome) <br>nod your head (nod) <br>shrug your shoulders (shrug) <br>top priority (priority) <br>so-called "something" (use either quotation marks or so-called, not both) <br>major speech (nearly always just a speech) <br>role model (model) <br>past experience (experience) <br>lived experience (experience) <br>personal experience (experience) <br>empirical research (research, or a study) <br>safe haven (haven) <br>the fact that (that wherever possible, which is not always) <br>the industrial, agricultural or services sector (industry, agriculture, services) <br>located in (in) <br>pre-prepared (prepared; the pre- is right there already) <br>pre-planned (planned) <br>in close proximity to (close to) <br>### Respect and clarity#### Your first duty is the truth (p34)* You may say slaves and homeless people instead of enslaved people and people experiencing homelessness because renaming the group does little and the stigma attached to one name often attaches to the other. * Good writing about their lives, using ordinary language, does more to help than linguistic reshuffling does.#### Don't use nouns to describe human beings (p35)* Use adjectives that modify a noun.#### _Replace_: (p35)blacks <br>gays <br>jews <br>disabled <br> <br>community + adj <br> <br>deprived (poor) <br>disadvantaged (poor) <br>underprivileged (poor) <br> <br>developing (poor) <br>underdeveloped (poor) <br> <br>visually impaired (blind) <br>hearing impaired (deaf) <br> <br>schizophrenics <br>wheelchair-bound <br> <br>suffer (unless they told you; have) <br> <br> -> In any case, think twice about whether any disability is part of your story; if it isn't, leave it out. <br>## Chapter 3#### The full stop is the writer’s best friend. (p37)* Frequent resort to the dot has two effects. First it reduces the chances of getting tangled in syntax. Second, the reader's memory has time to rest.### Sentences within sentences#### Avoid Russian-Doll nesting of sentences. (p39)* Just because it's possible doesn't mean it's desirable.### Passive versus active#### Prefer the active (p40-41)* It is more direct, shorter and simpler. The active is the default, and so easier to process.* Sometimes the passive is better:  * To preserve focus. (When writing about Abraham Lincoln, you might say "Lincoln was shot" rather than "John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln" unless you want to focus on the shooter.)  * To preserve flow. (If you have mentioned something in a previous sentence, it often makes sense to make it the subject of the next sentence, even if that requires a passive.)  * When the agent is unknown or unimportant.#### Try to keep the agent in the sentence (p40)* The agent is the doer. In the active voice subject and agent are the same. In the passive they are seperated.### Avoiding ambiguity#### Use functional words (p42)*  As you write, you should trim most words you can. But don’t trim more than you can. Those little, unlovely functional words help you avoid ambiguity.### The role of punctuation#### The Dash (p43)* Use the long (em) dash (—)* A good rule of thumb is no more than one dash or pair of dashes in a paragraph.#### The Hyphen (p43)* Use the hyphen (-) to join words that are closely related and function as a single concept.* Use the hyphen when two (or more) words are used to modify another word.### Other common confusions#### Whom is an object pronoun (p44)#### Who is a subject pronoun (p44)#### Prepositions (like between) are followed by object pronouns: me, you, him, her, us, them, whom. (p44)#### Singular subjects get a singular verb, with an -s at the end. Plural subjects get a verb with no -s. (p45)* Words ending in -ics for an academic discipline or the topic in the abstract are singular.* But when preceded by the, these are often plural* Other -ics that do not represent a eld of knowledge or abstract idea are ordinary plurals* Treat nouns as singular or plural depending on the focus of the sentence. For example, "Liverpool" are playing well, but "Liverpool" is loosing fans.#### Long subjects do not need to be followed by a comma. (p46)#### Items in a list should be in the same grammatical form. (p46)#### Co-ordinations involving Both/and and either/or require the items that follow to be parallel in form. (p46)#### Asides are set off by commas on both ends. (p47)#### Prefer the possessive form when followed by gerunds. (p47)#### When using the past subjunctive _to be_ is irregular (If I were). (p47)#### When using the present subjunctive in the third-person singular the verb loses its -s and _to be_ is irregular (So be it). (p47)#### Put modifiers where they are clearest and strongest. That is sometimes between to and its verb. (p49)#### You can end a sentence with a preposition. (p49)#### There is no reason to avoid putting conjunctions at the beginning of sentences. (p50)#### Avoid dangling modifiers, they cause for confusion and humorous effect and rarely server a purpose. (p50)#### You may use they as a singular pronoun, but sometimes it is better to pluralise. (p52)#### The ’s, known as the possessive, implies many kinds of relationships. (p52-53)#### In the past tense, use might. (p54)#### Use might for counterfactuals. (p54)#### Whose is the original genitive of what and later of which, as well as of who. (p55)* Rephrase with of which where you can, but not when this produces something clumsy.## Chapter 4## Chapter 5## Chapter 6## Chapter 7## Chapter 8## Chapter 9## Chapter 10
