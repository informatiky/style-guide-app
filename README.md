# Digital Style Guide

## **About**
The purpose of this tool is to make your writing more consistent, clear and respectful. The rules applied to your text come from the book Writing with Style by Lane Green. Through natural language processing, a form of artificial intelligence, your text gets analysed for specific words, their root and their part of speech in the sentence. Once the script found a fitting word, it will alert you by underline the word in question. Hover over it to find out more. The tool intentionally does not offer a simple "accept" button because it encourages your voice and tries to teach you with every mistake you make.

## **Github**
The code to this website and the script which checks for the rules is hosted on Github and publicly available to anyone interested under the "GNU Affero General Public License v3.0". In short, you are allowed to copy the code and use it commercially, but you will always need to make your source code public.

## **Usage**
To start using the code, clone the repostiory and make a Virtual Environment using ```python3 -m venv .venv``` inside the directory of the project. Activate it and then, from there, you can install the required packages available in requirements.txt.
